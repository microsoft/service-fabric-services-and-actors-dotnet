# Azure/service-fabric-services-and-actors-dotnet

Reliable Services and Reliable Actors are Service Fabric application frameworks for building highly-scalable distributed cloud applications.

Reliable Services is a light-weight framework for writing services that integrate with the Service Fabric platform and benefit from the full set of platform features. Built on top of Reliable Services, the Reliable Actor framework is an application framework that implements the Virtual Actor model, based on the actor design pattern. More information on Service Fabric programming models can be found in the [Service Fabric documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-choose-framework).

This repo builds the following packages:
 - Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services
 - Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting
 - Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Wcf
 - Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Actors
 - Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Actors.Wcf

## Getting Started

### Prerequesites
Each project is a normal C# Visual Studio 2017 project. At minimum, you need [MSBuild 15](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/what-s-new-in-msbuild-15-0), [PowerShell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/mt173057.aspx), [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) and [.NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48130) to build and generate NuGet packages.

We recommend installing [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) which will set you up with all the .NET build tools and allow you to open the solution files. Community Edition is free and can be used to build everything here.

### Build
To build everything and generate NuGet packages, run the **build.ps1** script. NuGet packages will be dropped in a *drop* directory at the repo root.

Each project can also be built individually directly through Visual Studio or by running the solution file through MSBuild.

Binaries in the build are delay signed, these are fully signed in the official builds released by Microsoft. To use the binaries or to run unit tests from the build of this repository, strong name validation needs to be skipped for these assemblies. This can be done by running **SkipStrongName.ps1** script available in the root of the repository.

For branches, please see [Branching Information](CONTRIBUTING.md#BranchingInformation)

## Development
We are currently working on transitioning all development to GitHub. For the time being we are continuing to do our own development internally. Upon each release of the SDK, we will push our latest changes to GitHub. We intend to bring more of our development process and tools into the open over time.

## Releases and Support
Official releases from Microsoft of the NuGet packages in this repo are released directly to NuGet and Web Platform Installer. Get the latest official release [here](http://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx?command=getinstallerredirect&appid=MicrosoftAzure-ServiceFabric-VS2015).

**Only officially released NuGet packages from Microsoft are supported for use in production.** If you have a feature or bug fix that you would like to use in your application, please issue a pull request so we can get it into an official release.
